# Smart Hire

Smart Hire is a centralized digital marketplace that connects customers with trusted service providers such as plumbers, electricians, cleaners, tutors, repair technicians, home-maintenance workers, and technical-support professionals.

The system allows customers to discover and book services, service providers to publish and manage their services, and administrators to manage the overall platform. Smart Hire also includes AI-powered features such as service recommendations, provider matching, customer assistance, and review summarization.

This project is developed as the final group assignment for the **Diploma in Advanced AI & Software Engineering** at **C-Clarke International Institute of Digital Sciences**.

## Database Tables

| Area | Table | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | `users` | Stores customer, provider, and admin accounts |
| Identity | `provider_profiles` | Stores provider-specific profile information |
| Catalog | `service_categories` | Stores service categories and subcategories |
| Catalog | `services` | Stores services published by providers |
| Catalog | `service_images` | Stores service image URLs |
| Catalog | `service_areas` | Stores provider service locations |
| Catalog | `provider_availability` | Stores provider weekly availability |
| Transactions | `bookings` | Stores service bookings |
| Transactions | `payments` | Stores payment records |
| Transactions | `reviews` | Stores customer ratings and reviews |

## Main Database Relationships

- One user may have one provider profile.
- One provider may publish many services.
- One category may contain many services.
- One service may contain many images.
- One provider may have many service areas.
- One provider may have many availability records.
- One customer may create many bookings.
- One service may receive many bookings.
- One booking may have one payment.
- One completed booking may have one review.
- One customer may save many favourite services.
- One user may receive many notifications.
- One AI conversation may contain many messages.
- One provider may have multiple generated review summaries.
- One service may have one embedding record.

## Database Development Rules

- Do not create application tables manually in Supabase when they are managed by Alembic.
- Model changes must be reviewed before generating migrations.
- Migration files must be committed to Git.
- The initial migration should be generated by one coordinated team member.
- Team members must pull the latest migrations before changing database models.
- Applied migrations must not be deleted without team approval.

---

# Prerequisites

Install the following before running the project:

- Git
- Python 3.10 or later
- Node.js
- npm
- Angular CLI
- VS Code or another code editor
- Access to the shared Supabase project
- Internet connection that allows PostgreSQL pooler access

Verify installation:

```bash
git --version
python --version
node --version
npm --version
ng version
```

---

# Initial Setup

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd smart-hire-cclark
```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the GitHub repository URL.

---

# Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend:

```bash
cd backend
```

## Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

## Activate the Virtual Environment

### Windows CMD

```cmd
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

When PowerShell blocks script execution for the current terminal:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

## Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Create the Environment File

### Windows CMD

```cmd
copy .env.example .env
```

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Update `backend/.env` with the required values.

Example:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://...
SECRET_KEY=replace-with-a-secure-secret
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=60
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

The team should normally use the same shared Supabase PostgreSQL project so that all members work with a consistent development database.

Never commit the real `.env` file.

## Run the Backend

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Backend URLs

Application:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Swagger documentation:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

Health check:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health
```

Database health check:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health/database
```

Expected database response:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Connected to Supabase PostgreSQL"
}
```

---

# Frontend Setup

From the project root:

```bash
cd frontend
```

## Install Packages

```bash
npm install
```

## Run Angular

```bash
ng serve
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:4200
```

---

# Database Migrations

Database tables are managed through SQLAlchemy models and Alembic migrations.

Run all Alembic commands from the `backend` directory.

## Check Current Migration

```bash
alembic current
```

## View Migration Heads

```bash
alembic heads
```

## Generate a Migration

Only after approved SQLAlchemy model changes:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe the database change"
```

Example:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "create initial smart hire tables"
```

## Apply Migrations

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

## Roll Back One Migration

```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

## Important Migration Rules

- Do not generate an empty migration.
- Review generated migration files before applying them.
- Ensure all model files are imported in `app/models/__init__.py`.
- Ensure Alembic loads `Base.metadata`.
- Only one coordinated initial migration should be created.
- Other members should pull the migration and run `alembic upgrade head`.
- Do not create duplicate migrations for the same schema change.

After the initial migration is applied, the following should appear in Supabase:

```text
users
provider_profiles
service_categories
services
service_images
service_areas
provider_availability
bookings
payments
reviews
favorites
notifications
ai_conversations
ai_messages
review_summaries
service_embeddings
alembic_version
```

# Git Workflow

## Main Branches

```text
main
develop
```

### `main`

Contains stable, reviewed, and submission-ready code.

### `develop`

Contains integrated development work before final release.

## Feature Branches

Each module must use a separate feature branch.

Examples:

```text
feature/auth-users
feature/service-catalog
feature/booking-notifications
feature/reviews-payments-admin
feature/ai-assistant
```

## Start New Work

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/module-name
```

## Commit Work

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(module): describe completed work"
```

## Push the Branch

```bash
git push -u origin feature/module-name
```

Create a Pull Request from:

```text
feature/module-name → develop
```

After integration testing:

```text

# Coding Standards

## Backend Standards

- Follow REST API principles.
- Use FastAPI routers.
- Use SQLAlchemy ORM.
- Use Pydantic schemas for validation.
- Keep business logic in service classes.
- Keep database queries in repositories when applicable.
- Use dependency injection.
- Use type hints.
- Handle errors using controlled exceptions.
- Never return database passwords or internal errors to users.
- Protect private endpoints with JWT authentication.
- Enforce role-based authorization.

Recommended flow:

```text
Router
  ↓
Service
  ↓
Repository
  ↓
SQLAlchemy Model
  ↓
PostgreSQL
```

## Frontend Standards

- Use Angular standalone components.
- Keep features inside their assigned folders.

- Use TypeScript interfaces.
- Validate forms.
- Display clear loading and error states.
- Keep layouts responsive.

## Naming Standards

Backend files:

```text
snake_case.py
```

Python classes:

```text
PascalCase
```

Python variables and functions:

```text
snake_case
```

Angular files:

```text
kebab-case.ts
```

- Supabase database passwords
- Supabase service-role keys
- Database connection strings
- JWT secret keys
- OpenAI API keys
- User passwords
- Production credentials

Passwords must be stored only as secure hashes.

OpenAI requests must be sent from the FastAPI backend, not directly from Angular.

Private APIs must require JWT authentication.

Role-restricted endpoints must verify whether the user is a:

- Customer
- Provider
- Administrator

The `.gitignore` must exclude:

```text
backend/.env
backend/venv/
backend/.venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
frontend/node_modules/
frontend/dist/
frontend/.angular/
```

---

# Before Starting Development

Every team member must verify the following after cloning.

## Backend

- Virtual environment can be created.
- Dependencies install successfully.
- FastAPI starts successfully.
- Swagger loads successfully.
- Health endpoint returns success.
- Database health endpoint returns success.
- Alembic connects successfully.

## Frontend

- Packages install successfully.
- Angular starts successfully.
- The application opens at `localhost:4200`.

## Database

- The shared Supabase project is accessible.
- The connection string is configured in `.env`.
- Existing migrations can be applied.

Only after these checks pass should feature development begin.

# Current Frontend Routes and Page Ownership

The shared authentication, guards, interceptors, navbar, sidebar, and dashboard layouts are already prepared. Team members should add feature code inside their assigned page folders and avoid changing shared auth or layout files without coordination.

Do not modify these shared files without coordination:

- `frontend/src/app/core/services/auth.service.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/core/services/token.service.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/core/guards/auth.guard.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/core/guards/role.guard.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/core/interceptors/auth.interceptor.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/shared/layouts/customer-layout/`
- `frontend/src/app/shared/layouts/provider-layout/`
- `frontend/src/app/features/admin/admin-layout/`
- `frontend/src/app/shared/components/navbar/`
- `frontend/src/app/shared/components/sidebar/`
- `frontend/src/app/app.routes.ts`

## Authentication Routes

| Route | Folder | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| `/login` | `frontend/src/app/features/auth/login/` | Authentication member |
| `/register` | `frontend/src/app/features/auth/register/` | Authentication member |
| `/unauthorized` | `frontend/src/app/features/auth/unauthorized/` | Authentication member |
| `/not-found` | `frontend/src/app/features/auth/not-found/` | Authentication member |

## Customer Routes

| Route | Folder | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| `/customer/dashboard` | `frontend/src/app/features/customer/dashboard/` | Authentication member |
| `/customer/profile` | `frontend/src/app/features/customer/profile/` | Authentication member |
| `/customer/services` | `frontend/src/app/features/customer/browse-services/` | Services module member |
| `/customer/favourites` | `frontend/src/app/features/customer/favourites/` | Services module member |
| `/customer/bookings` | `frontend/src/app/features/customer/bookings/` | Bookings module member |
| `/customer/notifications` | `frontend/src/app/features/customer/notifications/` | Notifications module member |
| `/customer/reviews` | `frontend/src/app/features/customer/reviews/` | Reviews module member |
| `/customer/ai-assistant` | `frontend/src/app/features/customer/ai-assistant/` | AI module member |

`/customer` redirects to `/customer/dashboard`.

## Provider Routes

| Route | Folder | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| `/provider/dashboard` | `frontend/src/app/features/provider/dashboard/` | Authentication member |
| `/provider/profile` | `frontend/src/app/features/provider/profile/` | Authentication member |
| `/provider/services` | `frontend/src/app/features/provider/services/` | Services module member |
| `/provider/service-areas` | `frontend/src/app/features/provider/service-areas/` | Services module member |
| `/provider/booking-requests` | `frontend/src/app/features/provider/booking-requests/` | Bookings module member |
| `/provider/availability` | `frontend/src/app/features/provider/availability/` | Bookings module member |
| `/provider/notifications` | `frontend/src/app/features/provider/notifications/` | Notifications module member |
| `/provider/reviews` | `frontend/src/app/features/provider/reviews/` | Reviews module member |
| `/provider/payments` | `frontend/src/app/features/provider/payments/` | Payments module member |
| `/provider/ai-insights` | `frontend/src/app/features/provider/ai-insights/` | AI module member |

`/provider` redirects to `/provider/dashboard`.

## Admin Routes

| Route | Folder | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| `/admin/dashboard` | `frontend/src/app/features/admin/admin-dashboard/` | Admin module member |
| `/admin/users` | `frontend/src/app/features/admin/user-management/` | Admin module member |
| `/admin/categories` | `frontend/src/app/features/admin/category-management/` | Admin module member |
| `/admin/services` | `frontend/src/app/features/admin/service-moderation/` | Admin module member |
| `/admin/bookings` | `frontend/src/app/features/admin/booking-monitoring/` | Admin module member |
| `/admin/reviews` | `frontend/src/app/features/admin/review-moderation/` | Admin module member |
| `/admin/payments` | `frontend/src/app/features/admin/payment-management/` | Admin module member |
| `/admin/test-system` | `frontend/src/app/features/admin/test-system/` | Admin module member |

`/admin` redirects to `/admin/dashboard`.

## Placeholder Page Rule

Customer and provider non-auth pages currently contain simple placeholder pages. These placeholders reserve route paths and make sidebar navigation work. Each module owner should replace only the files inside their assigned folder when implementing the real page.

For example:

- Services member replaces `frontend/src/app/features/customer/browse-services/` and `frontend/src/app/features/provider/services/`.
- Bookings member replaces `frontend/src/app/features/customer/bookings/` and `frontend/src/app/features/provider/booking-requests/`.
- Notifications member replaces `frontend/src/app/features/customer/notifications/` and `frontend/src/app/features/provider/notifications/`.
- Reviews member replaces `frontend/src/app/features/customer/reviews/` and `frontend/src/app/features/provider/reviews/`.
- AI member replaces `frontend/src/app/features/customer/ai-assistant/` and `frontend/src/app/features/provider/ai-insights/`.
